Input:

configuration = {
	"Mainstream": ["Static", "Smart Answers", "Publisher", "Frontend"],
	"Whitehall": ["Static", "Whitehall"],
	"Transition": ["Router"]
	other = EE
}

    // for each project {
    //  Check if they are listed in dashboard_config
    //  if yes, list them in those categories 
    //  if no, just put them at the end
    // }

Output:

*Mainstream
(Static) (Smart Answers) (Publisher) (Frontend)

*Whitehall* 
(Static) (Whitehall)

*Transition*
(Router)

*Other*
(a) (b) (c)

Idea: Add categories to ccdash without actually touching the XML file

Categories added, now to add the projects under these lists and get them to update dynamically 
1) figure out how to read JSON data from JS
2) use the JSON data to get data into categories
