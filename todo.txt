Input:

configuration = {
	"Mainstream" => ["Static", "Smart Answers", "Publisher", "Frontend"],
	"Whitehall" => ["Static", "Whitehall"],
	"Transition" => ["Router"]
	other = EE
}

Output:

*Mainstream
(Static) (Smart Answers) (Publisher) (Frontend)

*Whitehall* 
(Static) (Whitehall)

*Transition*
(Router)

*Other*
(a) (b) (c)

Idea: Add categories to ccdash without actually touching the XML file

Categories added, now to add the projects under these lists and get them to update dynamically 
	(Transitions has listed all of them, and updates them correctly... for some reason)
